# My Tribute Page - Joseph Farrell

## Why I chose roguelike games
I chose to do my tribute page on a video game genre that I love which is roguelite/roguelike games. There is some debate among experts as to which games fit into which genre but I just decided to use roguelite as it's the genre I've seen described most.
I have spent a lot of time playing the different games within the genre so it only felt right to choose this as my topic. 

## What I learned

* Using the id attribute to change different aspects
* Different CSS properties to customise how my page looks
* How to use different syntax for using HTML and CSS together  

## Reflections
I think it was difficult at first to get to grips with understanding how to use what I had learned to make the changes I wanted to make.
I found myself needing to go over a lesson that I had already done when I didn't understand it but once I had read through it and tried again, it was great to see when it had worked.
I think there will be a lot of trial and error as the course progresses but this has made me very excited to start learning more!
